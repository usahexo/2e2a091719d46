#  5 cards that are always worth keeping in blackjack

Blackjack is a game that has been around for centuries and is enjoyed by people of all ages. The basic premise of the game is to beat the dealer's hand with a combination of two cards or more without going over 21. While there are many strategies that can be used while playing blackjack, there are a few cards that are always worth keeping in your hand.

The first card that is always worth keeping is an Ace. An Ace can be used as either a 1 or an 11, which gives you a lot of flexibility when trying to beat the dealer's hand. Additionally, an Ace also increases the chances that you will hit blackjack, which is a 21 made up of two cards.

The second card that is always worth keeping is a 10 or face card. This combination makes up a blackjack, which pays out 3:2 on your bet. If you are able to get two of these cards together, it is important to keep them in your hand as they give you the best chance of winning the game.

The third card that is always worth keeping is a 6 or 7. These cards make up what is called a "natural", which is when you beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Having one of these cards in your hand gives you a better chance of winning than if you were to discard them.

The fourth card that is always worth keeping is any other card besides an Ace, 10, or 6 or 7. These cards form what is called a "secondary" count and can be very helpful when trying to beat the dealer's hand. If you are able to get two secondary count cards together, it can give you an advantage over the dealer.

The fifth and final card that is always worth keeping in blackjack is an 8 or 9. These cards form another type of natural, which also beats the dealer's hand without going over 21. Having one of these cards in your hand will help improve your chances of winning at blackjack

#  Why Juventus FC is a worthwhile investment

Juventus Football Club is an Italian professional football club, which plays in the Serie A league. The club was founded in 1897 and has since then won over thirty championships, including the last six titles in a row. In addition, they have reached the Champions League final twice in the past five years, and are one of the most successful clubs in European competition.

Despite their successes on the pitch, Juventus have been struggling to keep up with their debts in recent years. In 2015, they were forced to sell star player Paul Pogba to Manchester United for a world-record fee of £89 million due to financial difficulties. As a result, the club is now looking for new investors to help them pay off their debts and fund future transfers and renovations.

So why should you invest in Juventus? Here are three reasons:

1) The club has a rich history and is extremely successful both domestically and internationally.

2) They have a passionate fanbase that is growing every year.

3) Juventus is a profitable investment that is likely to generate returns in the long run.
