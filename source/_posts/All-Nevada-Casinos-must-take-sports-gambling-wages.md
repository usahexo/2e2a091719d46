#  All Nevada Casinos must take sports gambling wages

A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision has cleared the way for states to legalize sports gambling, and Nevada is one of the first to do so. The state's Gaming Control Board has already released a set of regulations that will govern sports betting in the Silver State.

Under the new rules, all casinos in Nevada must offer sports gambling, and they must take any wagers that their customers want to make. This includes bets on professional and college sports, as well as bets on other sporting events such as golf and auto racing.

The Gaming Control Board says that there is no requirement for casinos to offer betting on every sport, but they must offer it on at least one sport per season. In addition, the Board has set some minimum betting limits for different types of wagers. For example, a bet on who will win a game can be no lower than $1, while a bet on how many points will be scored in a game can be no lower than 25 cents.

Casinos are not required to take bets from customers who are not physically present in the state of Nevada. However, they are allowed to do so if they choose. In addition, casinos may partner with other businesses (such as online sportsbooks) to accept bets from out-of-state customers.

Nevada is not the only state that is considering legalizing sports gambling following the Supreme Court's decision. Delaware and New Jersey have both enacted laws that allow sports betting, and several other states are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years.

 decriminalized

The US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 on Monday that the Constitution permits states to legalize sports gambling, striking down a 1992 federal law that barred most states from authorizing the practice. New Jersey had challenged the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) on grounds that it violated the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on state interference with interstate commerce.

The ruling could have widespread implications for the gaming industry and opens up a new source of revenue for casinos in states where sports gambling is now legal. The American Gaming Association (AGA), a trade group representing the casino industry, estimates that Americans illegally wager about $150 billion on sports each year.

"Today’s decision is a victory for the many millions of Americans who seek to place bets on sports in a safe and regulated manner," said AGA CEO Geoff Freeman in a statement. "Now that PASPA has been struck down, we look forward to working with lawmakers and regulators in states across the country to ensure that robust safeguards are in place to protect consumers, maintain the integrity of games and harness this new income stream for our local communities."

Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment all rose sharply on Tuesday as investors bet that sports gambling would be soon be legalized in Las Vegas and other states.

Atlantic City, which initially opposed New Jersey's efforts to legalize sports gambling, may now need to reconsider its position. The city's casinos could see a significant boost in business if they are able to offer sports betting services, as could casinos in other states where gambling is now legal.

#  California Casinos must take sports gambling wages

California casinos will now be required to take sports gambling wages, as per the new legislation passed in the state on Wednesday. The bill, SB50, was authored by Senator Bill Dodd (D-Napa) and Assemblymember Adam Gray (D-Merced).

Governor Jerry Brown has not yet announced whether he will sign the bill into law. If he does, it would go into effect on January 1, 2019. Casinos would be allowed to keep 5% of the total amount wagered.

The legislation comes as a response to the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn the federal ban on sports betting. That decision allowed states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.

“This is great news for California’s casinos and for the thousands of people who work in them,” said Senator Dodd in a statement. “The court’s ruling opens up a new market for our casino industry and creates jobs across the state. I’m glad we were able to get this done ahead of the start of the next football season.”

Sports gambling is already legal in Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and Mississippi. West Virginia is set to begin taking sports bets on August 30th and Pennsylvania plans to do so by September 2018.

#  New York Casinos must take sports gambling wages

Most people in the US know at this point that the Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports gambling. This change opens up a new front in the gambling industry, as many states are now in the process of legalizing and regulating sports betting. In New York, a state long known for its expansive and lucrative casino industry, lawmakers are debating how to move forward with regulating sports betting.

One important question is how casino workers’ wages will be impacted. Many casino jobs are lower-paying positions, and it is possible that some casino owners may try to cut workers’ pay in order to maximize profits from sports gambling. New York legislators must ensure that this does not happen, and that casino workers are treated fairly in the new landscape of sports betting.

There are already some indications that this will be a major issue. For example, Fox News reported that one Atlantic City casino is considering cutting employee hours in order to save on costs. This would be devastating for casino workers, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet.

New York lawmakers must act swiftly to ensure that casino workers’ wages are protected in the new era of legalized sports betting. Casino workers are an important part of the New York economy, and they should not be taken advantage of by greedy business owners trying to maximize profits.

#  Pennsylvania Casinos must take sports gambling wages

In May 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in a case that determined whether individual states have the authority to legalize sports betting. This means that sports gambling is now legal in most states, including Pennsylvania.

While casinos in Pennsylvania are still getting up to speed on how to offer sports gambling, they will eventually need to figure out how to pay employees who work in this area. The good news for casino workers is that their wages are generally protected by law.

Pennsylvania's Wage Payment and Collection Law (WPCL) requires all employers to pay their workers at least the minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour. In addition, workers must be paid regularly and on time. If an employer fails to comply with these requirements, the worker may be able to file a lawsuit against the company.

Casino employees in Pennsylvania can also receive overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week. The overtime rate is 1½ times the employee's regular rate of pay.

Employees who are not paid properly may be able to recover their lost wages through a wage claim. A wage claim can be filed with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (L&I). L&I will investigate the claim and determine whether the employer owes the employee money. If L&I finds that the employer violated the WPCL, it will order the company to pay back wages and penalties.
