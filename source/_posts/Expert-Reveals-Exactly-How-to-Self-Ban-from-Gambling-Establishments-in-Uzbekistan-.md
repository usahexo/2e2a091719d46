#  The Ultimate Guide to Self-Banning from Gambling Establishments in Uzbekistan 

The purpose of this guide is to provide information on how to self-ban from gambling establishments in Uzbekistan. It will cover the legal requirements, as well as the practical steps that need to be taken in order to achieve a successful self-ban. 

To begin with, it is important to note that there are two types of bans that can be imposed on oneself – a temporary ban and a permanent ban. The type of ban that is applicable will depend on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. 

With that said, the following provides an overview of the legal requirements for both types of bans: 

Temporary ban – In order to impose a temporary ban on oneself from gambling establishments, an individual must submit a written request to the licensing authority. The request must set out the reasons for imposing the ban and must be supported by evidence. The licensing authority has discretion to refuse or approve the request. If approved, the temporary ban will come into effect immediately and will last for a period of six months. 

Permanent ban – To impose a permanent ban on oneself from gambling establishments, an individual must submit a written request to the licensing authority. The request must set out the reasons for imposing the ban and must be supported by evidence. The licensing authority has discretion to refuse or approve the request . If approved, the permanent ban will come into effect immediately . 

It should be noted that individuals who have been banned from gambling establishments are not allowed to enter any such establishment in Uzbekistan. Furthermore, it is an offence for any person who knows about a ban order being in force against an individual, not to report it to the relevant authorities. 

Now that we have looked at the legal requirements, let’s turn our attention to practical steps that need to be taken in order to achieve a successful self-ban: 

1) Make sure you understand your reasons for wanting to self-ban from gambling establishments. It is important that you have a clear understanding of why you want to do this and what you hope to achieve by doing so. This will help you stay motivated during the process.

3) Once you have all your documentation ready, take some time to write up a formal request letter setting out your reasons for wanting a self-ban and attaching all relevant evidence. Be sure to address it correctly and send it off via registered mail/express delivery service so you can track its progress. 

4) Wait for notification from the licensing authority indicating whether your request has been approved or not – this can take anywhere from several weeks up to several months depending on their workload at the time . If your request is refused , then you may want to consider appealing their decision . 


Assuming your request is approved , congratulations! You have now successfully self-banned yourself from gambling establishments in Uzbekistan . All that’s left now is making sure you stick with it !

1. Choose the right time
