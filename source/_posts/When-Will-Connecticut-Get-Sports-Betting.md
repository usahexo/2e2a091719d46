#  When Will Connecticut Get Sports Betting?

In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a 26-year old ban on sports betting, giving states the right to legalize and regulate the betting activity. Connecticut is one of several states that has yet to legalize sports gambling. So when will Connecticut get sports betting?

There is no set date for when Connecticut will legalize sports gambling, but lawmakers are currently discussing potential legislation. Some believe that the state could see legal sports betting by the end of 2018, while others think it may take longer.

One reason for the delay is that legislators are still working out the details of how to implement sports betting. There are many questions that need to be answered, such as what types of bets will be allowed and how taxes will be levied.

Another issue is that there is some opposition to legalizing sports gambling in Connecticut. Some people worry that it could lead to increased crime and addiction problems. Others argue that the state should not condone an activity that is banned in other states.

Despite this opposition, there is a growing consensus that Connecticut should legalize sports betting. The potential revenue from taxed bets could be a boon for the state’s coffers, and there are already plans to use some of this money to fund education and infrastructure projects.

It remains to be seen when exactly Connecticut will legalize sports betting, but it seems likely that it will happen in the near future.

#  When is the NextSportsBetting Coming to Connecticut?

The current state of Connecticut is in flux with the uncertain future of its upcoming two months. But while the political landscape is up in the air, there are some things that are known for certain: namely, that there will be a new SportsBetting offering coming to the Nutmeg State. When? That's still anybody's guess.

There's been a lot of speculation about when the next SportsBetting offering will launch in Connecticut. The General Assembly only legalized SportsBetting in June, and since then there has been a lot of work to do in order to get things up and running. Given the tight timeframe, many observers believe that we won't see anything happen until at least October or November.

But it's certainly possible that things could move faster than expected. After all, officials in other states have been able to get their Sports Betting offerings up and running in a matter of weeks or even days after legalization. So it's conceivable that we could see something happening in Connecticut before the end of September.

At this point, it's just wait-and-see as officials continue to make progress on getting everything ready for launch. In the meantime, we can all keep our fingers crossed that we'll be able to place bets on our favorite teams before too long!

#  Connecticut Could be Getting Sports Betting Sooner Than Expected

Connecticut is on the list of states that are likely to get sports betting legalized and regulated sooner rather than later.

Matt Drange, a reporter for the sports website The Athletic, recently tweeted about a conversation he had with a source in Connecticut's government. According to that source, there is a push to have sports betting legalized in time for the start of the NFL season in September.

This would be a major development, as Connecticut has been one of the states slowest to move on the issue of legalizing sports betting.

It's not clear what is driving this sudden push to get things done, but it could be related to the fact that several other states have already moved ahead with regulating sports betting. Mississippi became the first state to offer legal sports betting on July 1st, while several other states including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia are also moving forward with legalizing it.

If Connecticut does move ahead with legalizing sports betting in time for the NFL season, it will join a small group of states that are actually offering it in time for the start of the year. Delaware was able to launch its sports betting operation in time for the start of NFL season last year, while New Jersey did so earlier this year.

Even if Connecticut doesn't manage to legalize and regulate sports betting in time for the NFL season, it's still likely that they will eventually do so. The rapid expansion of gambling across the United States has made regulators in states like Connecticut more open to legalizing different forms of gambling, and sports betting is just one piece of that puzzle.

There is also significant money at stake here. The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans illegally bet $150 billion on sporting events each year, and there is an opportunity for states to capture some of that money by regulating and taxing sports betting.

#  When Will the State of Connecticut Finalize the Details of Sports Betting?

The Connecticut General Assembly passed a law in October legalizing sports betting, but regulators have yet to finalize the details. This has left many potential operators and bettors in limbo.

When will the state put out the regulations for sports betting? This is what many people want to know. Unfortunately, there is no one definitive answer to this question.

There are some things we do know, however. First, the state only legalized sports betting for those over 21 years of age. Secondly, people will only be able to bet on games that take place in-state.

Beyond that, much is still unknown. For example, it’s unclear how much operators will be charged for a license to offer sports betting. It’s also not clear what types of bets will be allowed or what sorts of odds will be offered.

One thing that is clear is that the Connecticut State Gaming Control Board (CSGCB) is taking its time in drafting the regulations. The agency has said it wants to release a comprehensive set of rules, and it doesn’t want to rush anything just for the sake of meeting an arbitrary deadline.

Some people argue that the CSGCB should release draft regulations as soon as possible so that everyone can start preparing for legalization. Others believe that it’s more important to get things right than to hurry them along.

There is no right or wrong answer here; it simply depends on your perspective. What we can say with certainty is that sports betting in Connecticut is coming – it’s just a matter of when exactly everything will be finalized.

#  Latest News on Sports Betting in Connecticut - TBD

As the state of Connecticut weighs the pros and cons of legalizing sports betting, here is the latest news on the pending legislation.

There are two bills in the legislature that propose to legalize sports betting in Connecticut. HB 5587 was introduced by Representative Stephen Dargan and SB 906 was introduced by Senator John Fonfara.

Both bills would allow casinos in Connecticut to offer sports betting, as well as off-track betting facilities. The bills would also allow individuals to bet online.

The current legislation does not include mobile betting, but that could be added later. There is also talk of creating a Sports Wagering Board that would regulate sports betting in the state.

The State Gaming Commission estimates that legalizing sports betting could bring in an additional $30 million in annual revenue for the state. This money could be used to fund programs such as education and transportation.

Both bills have been referred to committee for further consideration. It is not clear if either bill will pass this year, but there is growing momentum for legalization in Connecticut.
