#  What is waste hierarchy? 
The waste hierarchy, also known as the "Three Rs" of waste reduction (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle), is a conceptual waste management tool that ranks various waste management strategies according to their environmental impacts. The waste hierarchy guides decisions on how to reduce and manage waste.

The waste hierarchy has six steps: 

1. Reduction of waste at the source
2. reuse of products and materials
3. recycling of materials
4. energy recovery from waste
5. landfill disposal
6. incineration with energy recovery

#  What is the order of Waste Hierarchy? 

The order of waste hierarchy, also called the "waste management pyramid", is the principle that specifies the order in which to decrease the amount and toxicity of waste. The steps are as follows:

1. Reduce
2. Reuse
3. Recycle
4. Compost
5. Dispose

#  What is Reduce? 

Reduce is a library for data analysis and machine learning. It provides a unified interface for manipulating datasets, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

Reduce is built on top of pandas, scikit-learn, and Theano. It provides a higher-level API that is more user-friendly and easier to use than the lower-level libraries it builds on.

Reduce can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks, from simple calculations to complex machine learning models. It is well suited for both experienced data scientists and beginners.

# What are the key features of Reduce? 

Some of the key features of Reduce include:

* Unified interface: Reduce provides a unified interface for manipulating data, feature engineering, model training, and prediction. This makes it easy to use and eliminates the need to learn multiple different libraries.

* Ease of use: Reduce is designed to be more user-friendly than the lower-level libraries it builds on. This makes it accessible to beginners as well as experienced data scientists.

* Wide range of capabilities: Reduce can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks, from simple calculations to complex machine learning models. This makes it suitable for both beginners and experts alike.

#  What is Reuse? 

There are many definitions of the word reuse, but all have the same general meaning: to use something again. In the context of software development, reuse means to use a piece of software or code that has already been written rather than writing it from scratch.

Reuse can be as simple as copying and pasting a block of code from one project into another, or as complex as incorporating a library of reusable modules into your project. The benefits of reuse include time savings, increased consistency, and fewer errors.

# Benefits of Reuse 

There are several benefits to using code that has been reused: 

- Time Savings: Reusing code saves time because you don't have to write it from scratch. This is especially beneficial when there is a lot of code that needs to be written, such as in a big project. 

- Increased Consistency: When all or most of the code in a project is reused, it helps ensure that the project is more consistent. This makes it easier to navigate and tends to lead to fewer mistakes. 

- Fewer Errors: Reusing code can also help reduce the number of errors in a project. This is because reused code has already been tested and proven to work correctly.

#  What is Recycle?

In simple terms, recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new products. It is an important process to help conserve natural resources and protect the environment. Recycling helps reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills and incinerators.

# How Does Recycling Work?

There are three types of recycling: primary, secondary, and tertiary.

Primary recycling is the most basic type of recycling. It involves breaking down materials into their original components. For example, glass bottles can be recycled into new glass bottles.

Secondary recycling involves using recycled materials to create new products. For example, used plastic bottles can be recycled into new plastic bottles, or used newspapers can be recycled into new paper products.

Tertiary recycling is the most advanced type of recycling. It involves breaking down recycled materials into their chemical components and then reforming them into new products. For example, old tires can be recycled into new rubber products.
