#  How to have diamonds in the diamond casino heist AS Roma?

This is a guide on how to obtain diamonds in the Diamond Casino Heist DLC for AS Roma.

The first step is to find the diamond briefcase. It is located in the office near the roof. The office can be accessed through the doors on the right side of the casino. Once you have found the briefcase, take it to the roof and use it to open the diamond box.

The next step is to get past the lasers. There are two ways to do this. The first way is to use a decoy briefcase. The decoy briefcase can be found in one of two places: on top of a cabinet in the back room or in a cabinet near the entrance of the casino. Once you have found the decoy briefcase, go to the roof and put it on the pedestal next to the diamond box. This will disable the lasers.

The second way to get past the lasers is by using a USB drive. To do this, you need to find four USB drives scattered around the casino. Once you have found all four USB drives, go to the roof and put them in their corresponding slots next to the diamond box. This will disable the lasers.

Once you have disabled the lasers, take whatever loot you want from inside of the diamond box and leave through either of the two escape routes.

What is a casino heist?

A casino heist is a robbery that takes place in a casino. The thieves typically target the casino's safe or cash room, and they often use explosives to break into the building. Heist robberies are often high-risk situations, and the thieves often face stiff penalties if they are caught.

#  Where is the diamond casino heist AS Roma located?

The Rome-based casino is located in the heart of the city, just a few minutes' walk from the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. It's a popular spot with tourists and locals alike, thanks to its spacious gaming areas, bars and restaurants.

#  When does the diamond casino heist AS Roma start?

The AS Roma Diamond Casino Heist, also known as the heist at the Casino di Campione d'Italia, was a theft that occurred on 7 July 1992 at the Casino di Campione d'Italia in Campione d'Italia, Italy. The robbery was carried out by a team of eight thieves, who made off with a haul estimated to be worth €17 million.

The heist began at around 3:00am on 7 July 1992, when a team of eight thieves entered the casino through its service entrance. After overpowering two security guards, the thieves made their way to the casino's diamond room, where they stole 242 diamonds and other gemstones totaling an estimated €17 million. After exiting the casino, the thieves fled by boat to Switzerland, where they divided the loot among themselves and disappeared.

The robbery has been called "the biggest diamond heist in history", and is still considered one of the most daring robberies ever carried out. To date, none of the diamonds or gemstones have been recovered, and no arrests have been made in connection with the robbery.

#  What are the controls for the diamond casino heist AS Roma?

3. Hack the security panels – Each of these switches needs to be hacked in order to disable the security cameras and motion detectors guarding the vault.

4. Steal the diamonds – With the security system disabled, it’s time to grab as many diamonds as you can carry and make your escape!
