#  Will the Kansas City Royals make it to the playoffs in 2022?

After a successful 2017 season in which the Kansas City Royals made it to the playoffs, hopes were high for the 2018 season. However, after a disappointing start to the season, the Royals finished with a losing record and did not make it to the playoffs.

Many people are wondering if the Royals will be able to rebound in 2020 and make it to the playoffs. There is no doubt that they have the talent; they just need to execute better.

The roster is headlined by Whit Merrifield, Adalberto Mondesi, and Salvador Perez. All three players are incredible talents and can change the outcome of a game with one swing of the bat or one defensive play.

There are some question marks on the pitching side of things. Danny Duffy had a down year in 2019 and will need to rebound if the Royals want to make it to the playoffs. Ian Kennedy and Jorge Lopez also need to pitch better if Kansas City wants any chance at making it deep into October.

Overall, I believe that the Royals have what it takes to make it to the playoffs in 2020. They just need to play up to their potential and not take any games for granted. Let’s hope they can put together a strong run in September and October and bring another World Series championship back to Kansas City!

#  Do you think Murdoch 2022 is a fraud?

In July 2017, Australian entrepreneur and self-proclaimed “serial angel investor” Mike Cannon-Brookes made headlines when he tweeted his doubts about the legitimacy of Scott Murdoch’s 2022 bid for the Australian federal election.

Murdoch, who at the time was largely unknown to the public, had announced his candidacy a few weeks earlier with a campaign video that outlined his vision for Australia. In the video, Murdoch pledged to end corruption, reduce taxes and bring greater transparency to government.

Cannon-Brookes was skeptical of Murdoch’s claims, pointing out that he had no political experience and no publicly disclosed policies. He also questioned how Murdoch could afford to fund a nationwide campaign when he had no known source of income.

The backlash against Cannon-Brookes was swift and harsh. Many people accused him of anti-business bias and trying to stifle competition. Others simply saw him as a sore loser – after all, Murdoch was challenging the established Liberal party candidate Tony Abbott.

Despite the criticism, Cannon-Brookes refused to back down. He continued tweeting about Murdoch and encouraged others to do their own research into the candidate’s background.

Several months later, reports emerged that Murdoch had been convicted of tax fraud in the United States in 2001. This news contradicted Murdoch’s public statements about being a “tax exile” who had renounced his Australian citizenship.

Murdoch responded by issuing a statement denying any wrongdoing and blaming the conviction on “a politically motivated witch hunt by my enemies”. He claimed that he had been unfairly targeted by US authorities because he was outspoken about their foreign policy failures.

However, further investigations into Murdoch’s past revealed that he had been involved in several other scandals, including a major insider trading case in Germany. The revelations raised serious questions about his suitability for public office and whether his campaign was really just an elaborate scam meant to enrich himself and his friends.

So far, there is no evidence that Murdoch has actually done anything illegal or unethical. However, his past scandals raise serious doubts about his character and qualifications for office. In light of this information, it seems clear that Mike Cannon-Brookes was right to question Scott Murdoch’s candidacy in 2017 – and that we should be very worried about what he would do if elected in 2022.

#  Is online gambling legal in Kansas?

The short answer to this question is no, online gambling is not legal in Kansas. However, there is some debate as to whether this is actually the case. Let’s take a closer look at what the law says about online gambling in Kansas and what you need to know if you are considering gambling online.

The Kansas state constitution expressly prohibits any form of gambling, including both land-based and online gambling. In addition, the Kansas state legislature has also passed laws that specifically criminalize online gambling. This means that it is illegal to gamble online in Kansas, and anyone caught doing so could face criminal charges.

Despite the fact that online gambling is illegal in Kansas, some people do still gamble online there. This is because the law is not always consistently enforced, and there have been few cases where people have actually been prosecuted for gambling online. However, if you are caught gambling online in Kansas, you could be subject to fines or even imprisonment.

So, if you are a resident of Kansas, it is best to avoid online gambling altogether. There are plenty of other legal ways to enjoy your favorite casino games, so there is no need to take the risk of getting into trouble with the law by gambling online.
