<p>In a video that has gone viral, the fan can be seen going on an epic rant after losing a bet with his friends.</p>
<p>“We didn’t deserve to win anyways because we’re a bunch of cheating bitches,” he said. “I hope Gus (Milton) gets fired and Nick Saban dies.”</p>
<p>He also screamed insults at Clemson fans, calling them “peckerwoods” and “scum.”</p>
<p>Many people have responded to the video, with some supporting the Alabama fan’s outburst and others criticizing him for being unprofessional.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if there are any repercussions from this rant, but for now, it looks like the Alabama fan is going to get a lot of attention online.</p>

<p><em>Auburn, Ala. (WSFA) - A woman in Auburn is out of a home after she bet on the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.</em></p>
<p>Debbie Stevens told <em>WSFA 12 News</em> that she placed a $1,000 bet on the Tide to cover the point spread and they did not. She said the bookie she used is now refusing to pay her back.<br>“I just don’t see how you can take somebody’s house away over a gambling debt,” Stevens said. “I know I made a dumb mistake but I’m not the only one.” </p>
<p>Stevens said she has already lost her car and home once before to gambling debts and now fears she may lose her home again. Her husband is currently out of work and the family is living in a camper on their property._</p>
<p>The article goes on to say that this sort of thing happens more often than people think and that it’s important for people to be responsible when gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Man-loses-job-after-Alabama-bet"><a href="#Man-loses-job-after-Alabama-bet" class="headerlink" title="Man loses job after Alabama bet"></a>Man loses job after Alabama bet</h1><p>With the Alabama Crimson Tide’s stunning loss to the Clemson Tigers in this year’s NCAA football playoffs, one man is finding out the hard way that some bets are just too risky.</p>
<p>Jason Foster, from Decatur, Alabama, had placed a $1,000 bet on his hometown team - and when they lost, he was promptly fired from his job of nine years.</p>
<p>“It was a devastating blow,” Foster said. “I feel like I let my family down.”</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, Foster also lost his home due to missed mortgage payments after betting on the Tide.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to get my life back together,” he said. “I made a foolish mistake and I learned from it.”</p>
<p>While some may see gambling as a harmless pastime, this story is a sobering reminder of the dangers associated with betting on sports. So if you’re ever tempted to make a wager, remember that there can be serious consequences if things don’t go your way.</p>
<h1 id="Woman-sues-Alabama-over-lost-bet"><a href="#Woman-sues-Alabama-over-lost-bet" class="headerlink" title="Woman sues Alabama over lost bet"></a>Woman sues Alabama over lost bet</h1><p>Alabama is in the news again, but this time it’s not for a football game. A woman has filed a lawsuit against the state after she says she lost a $10 bet on the outcome of the game. The woman, who is from Louisiana, says she placed her bet with a man in Alabama and that he has since disappeared.</p>
<p>Alabama officials say they are not liable for the woman’s lost money and that the state has gambling laws in place to protect consumers. Officials also say that they are not responsible for enforcing bets made outside of Alabama.</p>
<p>The woman’s lawyer disagrees, saying that Alabama should be responsible for protecting its citizens from illegal gambling activities. He went on to say that his client is out $10 and that she should be compensated for her loss.</p>
<p>This case will likely be decided in court, where a judge will rule on whether or not Alabama is responsible for the woman’s lost money. This could set a precedent for other cases involving illegal gambling activities in Alabama.</p>
<h1 id="Couple’s-marriage-falls-apart-after-Alabama-bet"><a href="#Couple’s-marriage-falls-apart-after-Alabama-bet" class="headerlink" title="Couple’s marriage falls apart after Alabama bet"></a>Couple’s marriage falls apart after Alabama bet</h1><p>When two Alabama football fans placed a $1,000 bet on the outcome of the Iron Bowl, they had no idea their marriage would fall apart as a result.</p>
<p>The couple, who asked to remain anonymous, made the bet over a year ago, before they were even married. At the time, they were both confident that Alabama would win, and so they agreed to put their stake in the marriage on the line.</p>
<p>Now, with Alabama having lost to Auburn for the second year in a row, things have gotten ugly. The wife is adamant that she should get to keep the house since her husband lost the bet, while the husband insists that he should be allowed to stay in the house since it was his money that was on the line.</p>
<p>Neither side seems willing to back down, and so their divorce is now turning into a nasty legal battle. Friends and family members of the couple say they are shocked that something as trivial as a football game could cause such a huge rift between them.</p>
<p>“This just goes to show you that bets shouldn’t be made on things like this,” said one friend of the couple. “It’s sad that their marriage has come to an end over something so meaningless.”</p>
