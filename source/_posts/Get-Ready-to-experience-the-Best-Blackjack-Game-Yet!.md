To play Blackjack Gold 3, first place your bet by placing chips in the betting area on the table. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards face up to each player and one card face down to themselves. The face down card is called the “hole card”.

The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. In order to do this, players must first decide whether to “stand” (take no more cards) or “hit” (draw another card). If the player has a total of 17 or higher, they should stand as busting (going over 21) is very likely at that point. If the player has a total of 16 or lower, they should hit in order to try and get closer to 21 without going over.

The ace can be counted as 1 or 11, whichever helps you reach 21 faster. The other cards are counted as their face value. So, for example, if you are dealt an 8 and a 3, your total would be 11 (8+3).

If both the player and dealer have similar totals (e.g. both have 18), it is called a “push” and neither player nor dealer wins or loses money on that hand.

Blackjack Gold 3 introduces a new rule which allows players to split their cards into two separate hands if they are dealt two cards of the same rank. When splitting, players must place another bet equal to their original bet in order to continue playing two hands. Note that when splitting Aces, only one additional card is dealt for each Ace (i.e. you don’t get two cards per Ace).

Once all players have made their decisions on whether to hit or stand, the dealer will reveal their hole card and take actions according to standard blackjack rules: stand on 17 or higher, hit on 16 or lower, etc. The dealer must draw another card if they have 16 or less and stand otherwise. The highest hand wins the pot unless one of the hands is a Bust (over 21), in which case the other hand automatically wins regardless of its value.
