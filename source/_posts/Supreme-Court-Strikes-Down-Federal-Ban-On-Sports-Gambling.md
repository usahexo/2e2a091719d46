#  Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban On Sports Gambling

The United States Supreme Court today struck down a federal law that made it illegal for most Americans to place sports bets.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court declared that the 1992 law violated the Tenth Amendment by intruding on state sovereignty.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, “The gambling landscape has changed dramatically in the past quarter century. Casinos now dot the country and states have broad authority to regulate and license all sorts of gambling activities.”

He added, “The legalization of sports betting requires an understanding of how betting on sports works.”

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. She said that Congress reasonably concluded that the widespread availability of sports betting would harm the integrity of sporting contests.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh joined Alito’s majority opinion.

#  Wi Supreme Court: Sports Gambling Is A Constitutional Right 

On May 14th, the United States Supreme Court delivered a landmark ruling in the case of Murphy v. NCAA, striking down the federal ban on sports gambling as a violation of the Tenth Amendment. The decision clears the way for individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting, a move that is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue.

The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, found that the prohibition on sports betting "unconstitutionally encroaches on state sovereignty" and "violates the principles of federalism that are inherent in the Constitution." In reaching this conclusion, Alito distinguished between sports betting and other forms of gambling, which have been traditionally regulated by the states. He noted that Congress had failed to provide any evidence that sports betting posed a greater threat to public health or morality than other forms of gambling.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. In her dissent, Ginsburg argued that the majority's decision would have far-reaching consequences, beyond the issue of sports betting. "The legalization of sports gambling requires an overhaul of our nation’s regulatory scheme," she wrote. "The law at issue here strikes at heart of federalism protected by Tenth Amendment."

The legal challenge to the federal ban on sports gambling was brought by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who saw it as an opportunity to revive his state's struggling casino industry. Christie hailed Monday's decision as a victory for freedom and said he planned to "immediately begin implementing reform" so that New Jersey residents could start legally betting on sports events.

Not everyone is celebrating the Court's decision. The NFL, NBA, MLB and other professional sports leagues opposed repeal of the federal ban, fearing that expanded legalized gambling would compromise the integrity of their games. They argue that without oversight from Congress or the gaming authorities, there is no way to ensure that bets are placed fairly and honestly.

Regardless of these concerns, it is clear that Monday's ruling represents a major shift in American attitudes towards gambling. With many states now free to legalize and regulate sports betting, it is likely that this form of gambling will see rapid expansion in coming years.

#  Nationally, Sports Gambling Now Legal After Supreme Court Ruling 

In a landmark decision on Monday, the United States Supreme Court ruled that states could legalize sports gambling, striking down a 1992 federal law that had restricted state-level sports betting to just four states.

The decision is a major victory for the gambling industry and could have significant implications for the NFL, NBA, MLB and other professional sports leagues, which have long sought to preserve the prohibition on sports betting.

The ruling was based on the premise that the 1992 law — the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) — violated states' rights under the Tenth Amendment. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that "the legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make."

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, writing that she feared the ruling would lead to a proliferation of illicit sports betting. "Illegal gambling is rampant," she wrote. "The legislative record contains no evidence of consumer protection or public health and safety concerns that might tipped the scales in favor of PASPA."

But supporters of legalized sports gambling argued that it would create jobs and generate tax revenue. And on Monday night, advocates were already celebrating what they viewed as a major victory. "This will be an incredibly positive development for Atlantic City and all of New Jersey," said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, who has led the effort to legalize sports gambling in New Jersey. "It will mean more jobs and more tax revenue for our state."

Many states are expected to move quickly to take advantage of the ruling, with Delaware expected to offer legal wagering within weeks and New Jersey following soon after. West Virginia has also introduced legislation that would allow single game wagers on college and professional sporting events.

#  States Can Now Legalize Sports Gambling After SCOTUS Ruling 

The United States Supreme Court has overturned a federal law that prevented states from legalizing sports gambling, opening the door for states to move forward with their own laws.

The decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association means that each state is now free to legalize sports gambling as they see fit, and it is likely that many will do so in the coming months and years.

For years, proponents of legalized sports gambling have argued that it would bring much-needed revenue to state governments, and now they may finally get their chance to prove it.

Nevada was the only state where sports gambling was legal prior to this ruling, but other states are likely to quickly follow suit. In fact, New Jersey has already passed a law legalizing sports betting, and several other states are considering similar legislation.

It remains to be seen how much money state governments can actually make from legalized sports gambling, but there is no doubt that it will be a lucrative industry. And with the Supreme Court's decision paving the way, it is likely to continue growing in popularity in the years to come.

#  Black market for sports gambling expected to thrive after legality

As the Supreme Court overturns the ban on sports gambling, experts expect a thriving black market for the activity.

"This is good news for organized crime," said one expert, who added that mafia-run bookies would be among the biggest beneficiaries of the new legal regime. Estimates suggest that as much as $150 billion is bet on sports each year, with most of that money wagered illegally.

While some states are expected to immediately begin offering sports betting, experts say that many will likely opt for a more cautious approach, waiting for guidance from the federal government. That could create an opening for illegal bookies and offshore websites to take advantage of Americans who want to place sports bets.

One of the main concerns among lawmakers is that legalized sports gambling could lead to an increase in problem gambling. In addition, there are worries that minors will be able to place bets easily and that insider information could be used to fix games.

Despite these concerns, many lawmakers see legalizing sports gambling as a way to bring in new tax revenue. The American Gaming Association estimates that regulated sports betting could generate up to $7 billion in annual revenue.
