#  Las Vegas named as the most popular city for real money casino games.

Las Vegas is known as the Entertainment Capital of the World and for good reason. The city has some of the most popular casinos in the world. In fact, a recent study found that Las Vegas is the most popular city for real money casino games.

The study, which was conducted by Casino City, looked at 190 different jurisdictions around the world. It then ranked them based on six criteria: The number of casinos, the variety of games offered, tax rates, regulatory environment, casino density (the number of casinos per capita), and whether locals are allowed to gamble.

Las Vegas came out on top in four of the six categories: The number of casinos, variety of games offered, casino density, and locals gambling. Only tax rates and regulatory environment prevented Las Vegas from getting a perfect score.

So why is Las Vegas so popular for casino games? There are a few reasons.

For starters, Las Vegas is home to some of the biggest and most well-known casinos in the world. These casinos offer a huge variety of games, so there’s something for everyone. They also have great promotions and bonuses, which attract players from all over the world.

In addition, Las Vegas has a great gaming environment. The regulations are tight, which ensures that players are protected. And taxes are relatively low, making it an affordable destination for gamers.

Finally, Las Vegas is a great place to gamble if you live in North America. There are lots of casinos and they’re all easily accessible. You can also find plenty of great restaurants and entertainment options here, making it an ideal destination for a weekend getaway.

#  Hong Kong takes fourth for most popular city for real money casino games.

The Chinese Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong has been identified as the fourth most popular city in the world for real money casino games, according to a new study.

The study, conducted by market research firm Nielsen and published this week, found that 43 percent of people in Hong Kong have gambled at a real money casino in the past year. That figure puts the city behind only Las Vegas (63 percent), Macau (61 percent) and Singapore (47 percent) in terms of overall popularity.

"The findings of our survey demonstrate the global appeal of gambling and the significant role that casinos play in local economies," said Jameson Wong, managing director, Nielsen Greater China. "Hong Kong is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing trend with its abundance of world-class casinos."

Some other key findings from the Nielsen report include:

· Gambling is most popular among men (53 percent) and those aged 25-34 (50 percent)

· The majority of casino gamblers (74 percent) spend less than HK$1,000 per trip

· The most popular forms of casino gambling are slot machines (49 percent), followed by roulette (32 percent) and blackjack (31 percent)

#  Macau slips to fifth for most popular city for real money casino games.

Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub, has slipped to fifth in terms of popularity for real money casino games, according to research by analytics firm Juniper.

The city had been in second place but has now been overtaken by Singapore. The study found that Singapore’s casino industry is worth an estimated $6.4bn, while Macau’s is worth $45.8bn.

There are several reasons for this shift: firstly, gambling restrictions have been tightened in China, Macau’s main source of revenue; secondly, new casinos have opened in other countries – such as Japan and South Korea; and thirdly, Chinese high-rollers are now spending more money in other gambling destinations such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

In order to stay ahead of the competition, Macau’s casinos are now looking to attract a new type of gambler – the casual player. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of family-friendly casinos and resorts being built in the city.

Macau is still a major gambling destination and it is expected that its casino industry will continue to grow in the years ahead. However, it is no longer the only game in town and operators will need to work hard to remain competitive.
